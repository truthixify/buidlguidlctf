# BuidlGuidl CTF Solutions

Welcome to my solutions repository for the [**BuidlGuidl CTF**](https://ctf.buidlguidl.com/) challenges! This repo serves as a comprehensive guide for solving each challenge, breaking down the vulnerabilities, explaining the exploitation process, and providing detailed walkthroughs for anyone interested in learning more about smart contract security.

## 🔥 About the CTF
The **BuidlGuidl CTF** is a series of Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges designed to test and improve your skills in Solidity, smart contract security, and Ethereum development. Each challenge presents a unique vulnerability that can be exploited to achieve the goal, typically minting an NFT or gaining unauthorized access.

## 📁 Repository Structure
- Each challenge has its own folder with:
  - **Challenge Overview**: Description and objectives.
  - **Contract Code**: The Solidity contract for the challenge.
  - **Vulnerability Analysis**: Breakdown of the contract flaws.
  - **Exploit Execution**: Step-by-step solution and exploit code.
  - **Result & Impact**: Result of the exploit and the impact.
  - **Fix Recommendations**: How to secure the vulnerable code.

## 🚀 Why This Repo?
This repository is for anyone looking to:
- Understand and practice smart contract security.
- Learn Solidity and Ethereum development by example.
- Gain insight into exploiting and mitigating vulnerabilities.

## 📖 Current Challenges Solved:
- Challenge 1: **Just Resgister**
- Challenge 2: **Unchecked External Call**
- Challenge 3: **Bypassing extcodesize**
- Challenge 4: **ECDSA Signature Verification**

I aim to solve more challenges and update this repo regularly!

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries Used
- **Solidity**: Programming language for writing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Remix IDE:** For quick exploit development, testing, and deployment.
- **JavaScript (Node.js):** For scripting and signature generation using `ethers.js`.
- **Etherscan:** To analyze contract code, transactions, and events.
